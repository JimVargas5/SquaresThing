# SquaresThing

    In both Python and Java, I found the point where they fail numerically (even with Java's Double and Long's) for the {2 squares combine to make another square} problem (for which of course there is no solution. 
Using the calculator app on my desktop yielded fruitful results. 
The number that both algorithms failed on was 93222358 (both algorithms thought this was an answer). 
However, this number is incorrect by 0.0000000039... which is pretty close. 
Also, my graphing calculator failed on the number (not to my surprise, at least). 
Sheesh.
